      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer. That&amp;rsquo;s mostly it. I am not very good at it, but somehow I found my way into several companies and dealt with some larger projects, so I think I might have some experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also practising Judo, although I guess I am not very good at that either. This blog does not contain anything about Judo. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually one would write here that they&amp;rsquo;re passionate about some language or technology, but that is not the case for me. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what I make myself believe from time to time. I will try making a point about not being super passionate about &lt;em&gt;new currently hyped technology X&lt;/em&gt; that just came out yesterday and is already the &lt;strong&gt;future of the web&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;trade; or &lt;strong&gt;the next revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;trade;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can provide some insights into the field though - and I hope that someone, especially new developers just starting out (looking at you, inexperienced college graduates) might find these insights useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because after all, developing software is a joy to me and I like doing it for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions and or comments, please you can send me an email using &lt;code&gt;schnuffifk+blog@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, using they public key you find on &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/schnuffi&#34;&gt;keybase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction: First post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First post hype!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erm. Not really. This is a first post to be made, but it contains nothing of interest really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted a blog to share my world view and my opinion with a world that probably could not care less about both of them - considering the sheer mass of blogs and opinions, tweets, facebook pages, likes, upvotes, kitty videos, doge videos and similar currently in existance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I hope you can find something useful to you here in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
